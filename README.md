# Letter Guessing Game

## Description
This Python program simulates a "typing" effect by randomly guessing each character of a word (including letters, numbers, and spaces) until it matches the user input. It showcases basic Python concepts such as string manipulation, randomness, user input handling, loops, and timing. The program provides an interactive experience by gradually "typing" the characters, simulating how someone would type the input on a keyboard.

## Features
- Randomized character guessing**: The program will guess characters randomly and build the word character by character.
- Interactive typing effect**: As the program guesses characters, it simulates a typing effect, creating a visually engaging output.
- Supports letters, numbers, and spaces**: The program handles a wide range of characters in the input word, making it versatile for various inputs.
